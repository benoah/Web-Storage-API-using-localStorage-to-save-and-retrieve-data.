# JavaScript 2 Module Assignment 1.

## Brief

- Use only plain JavaScript for this MA.
- Use modules (imports and exports) and reusable functions where appropriate.

This is the API endpoint you will use:

> https://t9jt3myad3.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/api/products

## Level 1 Process

- Connect to the API and display the name and price property of each result.
- Display some kind of loading indicator while the API call is in progress.
- Add an input that filters the results by maximum price. This can be on the keyup event on the input, or the click event of a button.
- For example, if a user enters 50, only results with a price of 50 or less should be displayed.
- Display a message if the filter returns no results.

## Level 2 Process

- Add a button or icon to each result.
- Clicking on the button should add or remove the result from a wishlist array stored in localStorage.
- Display the contents of the array on a page called wishlist.html.
- Display a message if there are no items in the wishlist.
